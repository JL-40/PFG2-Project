## Description
This project will be creating a survival FPS game. The player must survive against some form of zombies or mutated creatures (to be determinted) using different weapons.

## Source & Credits
To help with creating the game, I will be following a tutorial and modifying the gameplay from there. Credits to [Natty Creations]'s Youtube channel which I will be using his tutorial to help with creating this project.

Playlist to the videos I will be using from his channel:

To help make a Inheritable class for all my guns, I will be using [Dave / GameDevelopment]'s Youtube video as a base then modify the code to work with the new Input System from [Natty Creations] tutorial and my own personal changes for the vision of my game.
